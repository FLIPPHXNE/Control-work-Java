Write a program that checks whether the entered string is a decimal number with an integer and a fractional part (template: consists of one or more digits, one decimal point, which can be at the beginning, middle or end of the number, and, in addition, the first character of the number can be a Plus sign or a minus sign). If this is the case, then the program should output the number of digits in the integer and the number of digits in the fractional part of the number.
